# Trainee tasks - find bug - mpmc

## Task:
This time I tried to implement a multi-producer multi-consumer program, but 
it doesn't seem to compile. I may have forgotten to implement some methods and might
have some mistakes using mutexes and condition variables.

Fix my code and make sure it works correctly.

## Requirements:
- You are allowed to modify everything in this repository.
- But don't alter the essence of the program.

## Note:
- To ensure thread-safety, you need to run your code multiple times.

## Expected output:
```
Sum = 4999995000000
Expected Sum = 4999995000000
```

### Happy coding!
